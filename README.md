These are some example python codes I've written. 

The multiphonon code was written as part of my PhD research in order to anayze neutron diffraction data collected at ORNL. It is written as a python package, but also can be run as a script if desired. Sample data is included. See the readme in the VISION_Multiphonon_Correction Directory for more information. 

The other projects in this repo are solutions to various Project Euler problems which I have been working on this year. https://projecteuler.net/
